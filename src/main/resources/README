Some comments:

● Maven is used in this project.
● There is a 4 tests that use Mock, Junit and Spring. These tests can be run with maven with command mvn test.

Bonus questions
● Add a new data series in the statistics chart with a linear trend line: Not done.

● Add a new data series with the simple moving average, where mavgPoints is the input parameter to the statistics API: Done
I added a serie call averageInvalidRequest to show avarage of invalid request. Considering the invalid request is one request that doesn't have a dimension or measure.

Look at the following example:

Request:
{ "last": 10, "timeUnit": "seconds", "mavgPoints": 2 }

Response:
{
    "totalRequests": 11,
    "totalQueries": 27,
